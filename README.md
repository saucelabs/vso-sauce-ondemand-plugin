# Updating Sauce connect

1) Run sod-main/binaries/download.sh

2) Strip the binaries, otherwise the VS marketplace will complain about the package being too big (it needs to be around 20MB).
   For the linux binaries, run strip then upx --ultra-brute.  For OSX and Windows, just run upx --ultra-brute, this should get the file sizes within range.

# Building the plugin

1) Prereqs (only need to run once):
```
  npm install
  npm install -g gulp
```

2) Update package.jsonâ€™s version

3) If building a production build
```
  export NODE_ENV=production
```

4) Finally, to actually build the vsix file
```
  gulp
  cd dist
  tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json
```
